Tests to be run in Unix enviroment

'make' in this directory to compile test

'java -jar Test.jar' to run test
'-filesize #' '-time #' to add filesize or execution time increase thresholds.
e.g. '-filesize 1.2' ~ Fail test if obfuscated filesize is more than 120% larger

'make cleantest' to remove test output files
'make clean' to remove binaries

Place lua programs to test in test_programs folder
Use programs with outputs that don't require input(causes testing to hang).
Programs with errors will error the same but will likely fail output checking due 
to line location modifications during obfuscation
